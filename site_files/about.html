        <h1 class="xx-large-text">Hi!</h1>

        <p>
            Im Alex, I'm 17 and live in the Uk. At the moment im doing my A-Levels where i am studying Maths, Further Maths, Physics, and Chemistry.
            <br><br>
            At the moment I quite like playing guitar, specifically rock and metal music, as well as hiking.
            <br><br>
            My favourite bands right now are Metallica, and Iron Maiden (who I saw live at the end of June 25)
            <br><br>
            Some additional hobbies include making things with my raspberry pi, flying my fpv drone, music, and messing with random bits of electronics.
            <br><br>
            In the future im looking at studying Engineering, Physics, or related subjects hopefully at some of the top unis.
