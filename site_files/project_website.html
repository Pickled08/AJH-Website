        <h1>This Website!</h1>
        <p>You may have guessed that this is a project im working on at the moment but here is the project page for it!</p>

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>This website is built using the Flask framework for Python. It uses a combination of HTML, CSS and Jinja templating to create the pages you see. The website is hosted on a server using Flask and Nginx on a Pi 2B with a cloudflare link to get it working with a domain. All apps on the pi are using docker to make it easier to manage as i have portainer and other custom scripts to auto update and reboot programe</p>
        <p>The website features a blog, project pages, an about page and a contact form. It also has user authentication for logging in and managing accounts.</p>
        <p>All source code is available on my GitHub apart from the nginx configuration as Im not sure how safe it is to share.</p>

        <h1>Nginx</h1>
        <p>Im using Nginx to acts as a reverse proxy for the Flask application, handling incoming requests and routing them to the appropriate backend services. This makes it so much easier to manage the server and handle traffic efficiently as im not directly accesing the flask backend. This is why I can have the maintanance page working whilest the flask server is down and it also handels the cloudflare Certificates for me. As I said makes it some much better than just using flask, and if I ever need to change the server or add more services, it's much easier to do so with Nginx.</p>
